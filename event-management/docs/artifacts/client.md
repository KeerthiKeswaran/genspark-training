# Client-Side Development History: EventSphere Frontend (A-Z)

This document provides a chronological timeline and technical log of all frontend features, layout configurations, state management integrations, and API integration paths built for the EventSphere client application.

---

## Phase 1: Project Scaffolding & Folder Setup
* **Request:** Create a modular, clean Angular workspace directory structure to accommodate state management, controllers, components, models, and helper services.
* **Discussion:** Discussed the use of empty folder structures and git rules. Temporary `.gitkeep` files were placed inside subfolders and subsequently removed to satisfy repository requirements.
* **Files Created:**
  * `client/src/app/components/`
  * `client/src/app/services/`
  * `client/src/app/interceptors/`
  * `client/src/app/guards/`
  * `client/src/app/models/`
  * `client/src/app/store/actions/`
  * `client/src/app/store/reducers/`
  * `client/src/app/store/state/`
  * `client/src/app/store/selectors/`

---

## Phase 2: Navigation Bar & Authentication Guards
* **Request:** Build a minimal-height, premium top navigation bar containing:
  1. The branding logo on the left.
  2. A search bar mapping the user's selected location.
  3. Action controls on the right (Settings, Bookings history, Create Event, and Profile Dropdown).
* **Discussion:** Configured layout behavior based on user sessions: dropdown features are hidden for anonymous guests and replaced with a prominent "Sign In" button, whereas logged-in sessions activate all profile options in a clean, single-line alignment.
* **Files Modified/Created:**
  * `client/src/app/components/home/navbar/navbar.ts`
  * `client/src/app/components/home/navbar/navbar.html`
  * `client/src/app/components/home/navbar/navbar.css`

---

## Phase 3: Homepage, Hero Slider & Localized Mock Data
* **Request:** Implement an interactive homepage featuring a Hero Carousel slider, a popular regions selector, and a scrollable About & FAQ section.
* **Discussion:** Decided to localize the application context to India and Tamil Nadu. Updated default coordinates from San Francisco to Chennai (`REG01`) and Coimbatore, Madurai, and Trichy.
* **Files Modified/Created:**
  * `client/src/app/components/home/home.ts`
  * `client/src/app/components/home/hero-carousel/`
  * `client/src/app/components/home/about-faq/`
  * `client/src/app/services/location-geo.service.ts` (Geolocation syncing)
  * `client/src/app/data/event.mock.ts` (Added localized events like A.R. Rahman Symphony Concert, Tech Expo, Madurai Chithirai Art Festival)

---

## Phase 4: Event Browsing, Searching & Filters
* **Request:** Build a `/browse` page acting as the primary landing page for searches, equipped with:
  1. Category select grids.
  2. Date filters (minimum/maximum event date).
  3. Sorting controls (sort by date ascending/descending, price ascending/descending).
* **Discussion:** Decided to remove standard "View Details" buttons from the cards, making the entire event card a clickable container navigating to the event detail view.
* **Files Modified/Created:**
  * `client/src/app/components/browse-events/browse-events.ts`
  * `client/src/app/components/browse-events/browse-events.html`
  * `client/src/app/components/browse-events/browse-events.css`

---

## Phase 5: Booking Wizard & Stripe Checkout
* **Request:** Build the ticket reservation flow, including:
  1. Quantity selector wizard.
  2. Platform convenience handling fees calculations (₹45 per ticket).
  3. stripe charge simulation.
  4. Success screen redirection.
  5. Back-to-browse revert mechanisms if checkout is interrupted.
* **Discussion:** Created mock endpoints for initiate-booking, convenience fee calculations, and transaction references mapping to prevent local runtime failures.
* **Files Modified/Created:**
  * `client/src/app/components/booking/booking.ts`
  * `client/src/app/components/booking/checkout/`
  * `client/src/app/services/booking.service.ts`

---

## Phase 6: Bookings History Dashboard & Cancellations
* **Request:** Create a user bookings log page showing active and past reservations, including check-in QR codes, virtual joining URLs, and cancellation buttons.
* **Discussion:** Designed a cancellation refund schedule:
  * Cancel > 48 hours prior: **90% refund**.
  * Cancel between 12 and 48 hours prior: **50% refund**.
  * Cancel < 12 hours prior: **Non-Refundable**.
* **Files Modified/Created:**
  * `client/src/app/components/bookings/bookings.ts`
  * `client/src/app/components/bookings/bookings.html`
  * `client/src/app/components/bookings/cancel-booking-modal/`

---

## Phase 7: Profile Edit & Account Deactivation Settings
* **Request:** Build a sidebar account page `/settings` with three views:
  1. **Profile Info:** Renders user information in read-only mode until a pencil Edit button is clicked, turning fields into text inputs and revealing a "Save Changes" action.
  2. **Password Reset:** Changing password prompts a 6-digit OTP verification code, followed by new and confirm password modal entries.
  3. **Close Account:** Prompts reasons survey (with other-specify textbox), confirmation by typing profile name, and an email OTP verification. Upon success, clears all localStorage, dispatches logout state, and redirects with a professional thank you splash.
* **Files Modified/Created:**
  * `client/src/app/components/account-settings/account-settings.ts`
  * `client/src/app/components/account-settings/account-settings.html`
  * `client/src/app/components/account-settings/account-settings.css`

---

## Phase 8: Location Auto-Trigger & Geolocation Permission
* **Request:** When a new user completes registration, automatically trigger the location selection modal and browser location permission prompt on the homepage.
* **Discussion:** Set up flags in localStorage (`'justRegistered'`) to identify new signups. If permission is granted, coordinates are translated to regions; otherwise, the user selects manually from the grid.
* **Files Modified/Created:**
  * `client/src/app/components/register/register.ts`
  * `client/src/app/components/home/home.ts`
  * `client/src/app/components/home/location-modal/`

---

## Phase 9: Registration Consent & Times New Roman PDF Viewer
* **Request:** Add mandatory registration checkboxes for *Terms and Conditions \** and *Data Storage Consent \**, along with an optional *Marketing Consent*. Clicked terms must open a PDF-like visual document container styled in Times New Roman font.
* **Discussion:** Designed a unified backend policy retrieval endpoint. Implemented the layout styled with Times New Roman text (`font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif`) embedded in a dark reader frame overlay in the register modal and the booking cancellation policy viewer.
* **Files Modified/Created:**
  * `client/src/app/data/consent.mock.ts` (Industry legal policy content)
  * `client/src/app/components/register/register.html` (Checkboxes, required validations, PDF modal layout)
  * `client/src/app/components/register/register.css` (PDF dark reader style sheets)
  * `client/src/app/components/bookings/cancellation-policy-doc/cancellation-policy-doc.css` (Font update to Times New Roman)
  * `client/src/app/services/auth.service.ts` (Unified `getConsentDocument('terms' | 'data_consent')` call targeting `api/policies/{type}`)
  * `client/src/app/components/bookings/cancellation-policy-doc/cancellation-policy-doc.ts` (Switched fetch endpoint to `GET /api/policies/cancellation`)

---

## Phase 10: Registration OTP Countdown Timer & Auto-Verification
* **Request:** Modify the OTP delivery and confirmation steps to include:
  1. A 30-second cooldown timer before "Resend" OTP is enabled/visible.
  2. The "OTP Sent!" message moved right next to the OTP field label.
  3. Disabling the OTP field until Send OTP is triggered.
  4. Auto-verification of the OTP code (mock value '123456') as soon as entered, displaying a loader or success/error icon directly inside the input container.
  5. The registration button remains enabled, but validation of inputs (email structure, 10-digit mobile number, verified OTP status, and policy consent) is triggered when clicked.
  6. Clubbing the Terms & Conditions and Data Storage consents into a single checkbox to improve user registration UX.
  7. Renaming site brand references inside mock text to the actual project name "GetMyEvents" and formatting policy layout structures to use plain prose points rather than markdown bullet points.
* **Files Modified/Created:**
  * `client/src/app/components/register/register.ts` (Added signal states, lifecycle timers, onOtpChange logic, validation functions on submission)
  * `client/src/app/components/register/register.html` (Combined checkbox inputs, relocated indicators, styled input wrapper, added verification SVGs)
  * `client/src/app/components/register/register.css` (Increased policy modal width to 720px, added spinner, indicators & inline label layouts)
  * `client/src/app/data/consent.mock.ts` (Renamed "EventSphere" to "GetMyEvents", removed bullet points in favor of paragraphs)
  * `client/src/app/services/auth.service.ts` (Added commented/mocked verifyOtp API client method)

---

## Phase 11: Booking Responses Sanitization & Dynamic Virtual Link Activation
* **Request:** Differentiate initiate booking response from confirm booking response. Prevent returning real virtual URL, password hash, checkin status, and booking status in initial confirmation. Activate virtual URL dynamically at the event timing only when the event starts and before it ends via a new active links endpoint.
* **Discussion:** Updated booking service client models, API method signatures (with mock fallbacks & commented real URLs), and checkout handling to process distinct DTOs. Updated My Bookings component to request active links and conditionally grey-out or enable "Join Meeting" action with proper CSS visual cues.
* **Files Modified/Created:**
  * `client/src/app/models/booking.model.ts` (Added `InitiateBookingResponse`, `ConfirmBookingResponse`, and `ActiveVirtualLinkResponse` interfaces)
  * `client/src/app/services/booking.service.ts` (Updated initiateBooking, confirmBooking methods signatures and added getActiveVirtualLinks method)
  * `client/src/app/components/booking/checkout/checkout.ts` (Correctly mapped the payment confirmation promise to safely reconstruct local BookingModel without compile errors)
  * `client/src/app/components/bookings/bookings.ts` (Modified loadBookings lifecycle to load active links and map/enable URLs dynamically; updated joinMeeting alert messaging)
  * `client/src/app/components/bookings/bookings.html` (Applied CSS conditional disabled styles to virtual meeting links button)
  * `client/src/app/components/bookings/bookings.css` (Added visual styles for grayed-out `.action-btn.join-meeting.disabled-link`)

---

## Phase 12: Backend Assets Integration Alignment
* **Request:** Align user asset paths to use a uniform directory structure.
* **Discussion:** The backend team migrated all user-specific assets (QR codes, support ticket receipts, reports) from `/assets/user/...` to `/assets/users/...`. Because the client application retrieves all files and resource links dynamically from database model properties (such as `Qr_Code_Path`, `ConcernUrl`, and `ReportUrl`), this change resolves without client code modifications, maintaining high resilience.
* **Outcome:** The frontend dynamically fetches and renders the QR code images and ticket JSON metadata from `/assets/users/...` endpoints natively.

---

## Phase 13: Dynamic URL Content Fetching & Pixabay CORS Fixes
* **Request:** Resolve the CORS policy error when loading Pixabay images, fetch the text contents of the event descriptions dynamically from their assets URLs, and correct policy endpoints and fetches for registration consent and bookings cancellation.
* **Discussion:**
  * Bypassed fetching Pixabay images via HttpClient/Ajax (which triggered CORS blocks due to CDN rules) in `PixabayService` and instead stored/served remote URLs directly, allowing the browser to render them via `<img>` tags natively.
  * Implemented an automatic background fetch in `EventService.mapEvent` that detects `/assets/...` URLs in the event `description_Url` field, downloads the text content via `HttpClient`, and updates the field reactively to display the description instead of the URL string.
  * Corrected registration consent (`register.ts`) and cancellation policy (`cancellation-policy-doc.ts`) components to map types (`'terms'` and `'data_consent'` map to `'General'`), fetch metadata, download MD files via HTTP, parse simple markdown tags, and bind the parsed HTML to the UI dynamically via `[innerHTML]`.
* **Files Modified:**
  * `client/src/app/services/pixabay.service.ts` (Modified search region caching to store/return direct URLs)
  * `client/src/app/services/event.service.ts` (Added background description URL content retrieval)
  * `client/src/app/components/register/register.ts` (Mapped policy types, injected HttpClient, and fetched/formatted file contents)
  * `client/src/app/components/bookings/cancellation-policy-doc/cancellation-policy-doc.ts` (Fetched and formatted C10001.md policy contents dynamically)
  * `client/src/app/components/bookings/cancellation-policy-doc/cancellation-policy-doc.html` (Added dynamic [innerHTML] binding and spinner template)

---

## Phase 14: Organizer Dashboard & Upfront Payment Flow
* **Request:** Build a comprehensive `/myevents` organizer portal featuring:
  1. A main **Dashboard View** showing total event count, tickets sold, net earnings, and upcoming event listings preview.
  2. An **All Hosted Events Directory** listing all organizer events with interactive status tabs (All, Live, Pending, Completed, Cancelled) and keyword searches.
  3. A **Create Event Wizard** collecting event details, dynamic venue pricing summaries, automated platform staff estimation calculators, ticket tier prices/capacities configurations, and Stripe checkout flow.
  4. Interrupted payment reversion mechanisms to cancel pending listings.
  5. Rerouting navbar triggers to direct users cleanly to these new interfaces.
* **Discussion:** Set up robust client forms, computed fee variables, loading animations, error banners, and modal confirmations to ensure premium responsive workflows.
* **Files Modified/Created:**
  * `client/src/app/components/organizer/dashboard/` (Created component TS, HTML, CSS files)

  * `client/src/app/services/event.service.ts` (Appended organizer API methods)

---

## Phase 15: Stripe Elements Integration
* **Request:** Integrate custom Stripe Elements (Option A - Embedded inputs) in place of the raw dummy payment cards text boxes inside bookings checkout and event creation upfront deposit forms.
* **Discussion:**
  - Configured global Stripe publishable token initialization provider `provideNgxStripe` in application configuration metadata.
  - Replaced manual input forms in bookings checkout template and create event wizard template with `<ngx-stripe-card>`.
  - Wired submit events to request tokenization from Stripe servers, sending token IDs (`tok_xxxx`) to C# controllers to confirm bookings.

* **Request:** Convert staff requirements option to a slider switch toggle disabled if no venue is selected, retrieve dynamic ticket tiers and category data from backend, retrieve age limits dynamically, and simplify the back-to-dashboard button design.
* **Discussion:**
  - Redesigned the staff requirements checkbox into a sleek switch toggle slider with explicit disabled visual state when no venue is assigned.
  - Linked the format radios and physical venue dropdowns to set up dynamic ticket tiers and capacities sourced directly from the chosen venue's metadata, making ticket capacity read-only for physical locations.
  - Fetched the age limit options dynamically via the new `GET /api/Event/age-categories` endpoint with error fallbacks.
  - Simplified the back button layout to a clean standard border layout button.

* **Discussion:**
  - Removed `qr_Code_Data` string from `BookingModel` and modified bookings view template and checkout confirmation dialog to display clean styled content layout without displaying internal raw hash strings.
  - Added base-server URL checks (`http://localhost:5106`) to resolve any relative `/assets/...` URLs in both dashboard and checkout flows, ensuring images load correctly.
  - Linked `amount_paid` field to show the exact purchase amount paid by the attendee.
* **Files Modified/Created:**
  - `client/src/app/models/booking.model.ts` (Updated models schema, removed `qr_Code_Data`, added optional `event_Image_Url` to confirm response)
  - `client/src/app/components/bookings/bookings.ts` (Mapped relative QR/image paths to absolute C# backend addresses)

---

## Phase 21: Azure-style Review Modals & Navigation Guards for Pending Reservations
* **Request:** Add confirmation modals for booking and event creation showing details as review (Azure-like UI), transition to payment checkout smoothly, and integrate automatic revert API calls when navigating away before payment completion.
* **Discussion:**
  - Designed and built Azure-style Review Modals for both ticket booking checkout and event creation steps using clean, structured tables, solid headers, and clear CTA actions.
  - Split the payment process: booking initiation (POST `api/booking`) and event initiation (POST `api/event`) are triggered upon confirming the review modal, storing the pending IDs.
  - Implemented a modular Angular functional router `canDeactivateGuard` to capture in-app navigation (such as clicking the back link, browser back actions, or keyboard shortcuts).
  - Configured the guard to invoke the respective revert APIs (`revertBooking` / `revertEvent`) in the background before allowing the route transition to complete.

## Phase 38: Booking Cancellation Animation
* **Request:** Enhance booking cancellation opacity fade and animation overlays.
* **Discussion:** Replaced abrupt DOM removal with CSS transition fades and Lottie/CSS animated overlays rendering on top of the original booking card.
* **Files Modified/Created:**
  - `client/src/app/components/bookings/bookings.ts`
  - `client/src/app/components/bookings/bookings.html`
  - `client/src/app/components/bookings/bookings.css`

## Phase 39: Secure User Profile Update with Email Verification
* **Request:** Handle asynchronous email uniqueness and real-time validation.
* **Discussion:** Attached `valueChanges` debounce listeners to the profile form. Hits `api/auth/user/check-email` before enabling OTP resend flows.
* **Files Modified/Created:**
  - `client/src/app/components/account-settings/account-settings.ts`
  - `client/src/app/components/account-settings/account-settings.html`
  - `client/src/app/components/account-settings/account-settings.css`

---

## Phase 40: Support Ticket Entity Selection Workflow
* **Request:** Introduce a modal to select events/bookings when creating tickets.
* **Discussion:** Built a tabbed modal (Events vs. Bookings) presenting cards for the user's historical records. Automatically binds the selected `TargetType` and `TicketId` (or event `TargetId`).
* **Files Modified/Created:**
  - `client/src/app/components/support/support.ts`
  - `client/src/app/components/support/support.html`
  - `client/src/app/components/support/support.css`

---

## Phase 41: Persistent Backend Integration for Support Tickets
* **Request:** Remove local storage dependency and integrate backend endpoints.
* **Discussion:** Completely ripped out the `localStorage` ticket queue. Re-wired the UI to fetch real tickets via `GET /api/Support/tickets` and submit via `POST`.
* **Files Modified/Created:**
  - `client/src/app/components/support/support.ts`


---

## Phase 42: Stripe Embedded Checkout & 5-Minute Payment Timeout
* **Request:** Implement a Secure Stripe Checkout Timeout and Automatic Transaction Rollback.
* **Discussion:** Migrated away from Stripe's hosted redirect checkout to an embedded checkout rendered inside the platform. A dedicated `/stripe-checkout` route was created as a standalone component that receives the `clientSecret` and session `createdAtUTC` timestamp via query parameters. A live countdown timer is computed from the original session creation time, ensuring it stays accurate even after page refreshes. When the timer reaches zero, the embedded checkout form is destroyed immediately, the appropriate rollback API is called, and the user sees a professional payment cancellation screen. The timer uses a `setInterval` tick that recalculates remaining seconds each second by comparing `Date.now()` against the backend-provided timestamp — no frontend drift.
* **Files Modified/Created:**
  - `client/src/app/components/booking/stripe-checkout/stripe-checkout.ts` *(created)*
  - `client/src/app/components/booking/stripe-checkout/stripe-checkout.html` *(created)*
  - `client/src/app/components/booking/stripe-checkout/stripe-checkout.css` *(created)*
  - `client/src/app/app.routes.ts` — Added lazy-loaded `/stripe-checkout` route
  - `client/src/app/components/booking/booking.ts` — Replaced `window.location.href = sessionUrl` with `router.navigate(['/stripe-checkout'], { queryParams })`
  - `client/src/app/components/organizer/create-event/create-event.ts` — Same redirect replacement for event creation payment
  - `client/src/app/services/booking.service.ts` — Updated `createCheckoutSession` return type to `{ sessionId, clientSecret, createdAtUTC }`
  - `client/src/app/services/event.service.ts` — Updated `createCheckoutSession` return type to `{ sessionId, clientSecret, createdAtUTC }`

## Phase 43: Admin Support Ticket Management Redesign & Escalation Tracking
* **Request:** Redesign the Admin Support Ticket management module and implement live escalation status tracking.
* **Discussion:** Reviewed the frontend integration for support tickets. Resolved missing data bindings that caused empty fields. Converted the static Escalate button into a dynamic tracking board. Implemented a robust frontend fetching strategy that continuously reflects the true status of escalations.
* **Files Modified/Created:**
  - `client/src/app/components/admin/helpdesk/helpdesk.ts`
  - `client/src/app/components/admin/helpdesk/helpdesk.html`
  - `client/src/app/components/admin/helpdesk/helpdesk.css`

---

## Phase 44: Staff Management, Pagination, and Search
* **Request:** Enhance the Staff Allocation interface with robust search, backend-driven pagination, and sorting capabilities.
* **Discussion:** Replaced client-side sorting and pagination with definitive backend-driven queries (`api/admin/staff`). Added a search functionality allowing lookup by Staff ID, Name, or Email. Replaced raw Region IDs with readable Region Names. Ensure duplicate records are prevented during transitions.
* **Files Modified/Created:**
  - `client/src/app/components/admin/staff/staff.ts`
  - `client/src/app/components/admin/staff/staff.html`

---

## Phase 45: Admin Navigation Sidebar Redesign
* **Request:** Transition the Admin portal to a collapsible left navigation sidebar with a dedicated color scheme.
* **Discussion:** Abstracted the administrative navigation into a standalone `<app-admin-sidebar>` component leveraging signals for a collapsible state (persisted in localStorage). Transitioned the active styling to a soft Cardinal Red and simplified the Admin Footer into a streamlined horizontal layout.
* **Files Modified/Created:**
  - `client/src/app/components/admin/sidebar/` (created ts, html, css)
  - `client/src/app/components/admin/dashboard/` (integrated sidebar)
  - `client/src/app/components/admin/moderation/` (integrated sidebar)
  - `client/src/app/components/admin/venues/` (integrated sidebar)
  - `client/src/app/components/admin/helpdesk/` (integrated sidebar)
  - `client/src/app/components/home/footer/footer.html` & `.css` (adjusted layout for admin context)

---

## Phase 46: Secure Admin Profile Management & OTP Password Reset
* **Request:** Make the admin profile view read-only except for passwords, and rebuild the OTP workflow to hit backend targets specific to administrators.
* **Discussion:** Modified the `AccountSettingsComponent`. Swapped the generic user profile extraction for a direct call to `AdminService.getAdminProfile()`. Enforced view-only mode for admins on the Name/Email fields. Rewired the OTP requests in the password change workflow to utilize `sendAdminOtp` and `resetAdminPassword`, mapping correctly to the backend administrative authentication endpoints.
* **Files Modified/Created:**
  - `client/src/app/components/account-settings/account-settings.ts`
  - `client/src/app/components/account-settings/account-settings.html`

---

## Phase 47: Finance Dashboard Stats Update
* **Request:** Add "Total Intake" metric to the Finance Dashboard and ensure both Total Intake and Total Revenue are properly fetched from backend and formatted in INR (₹).
* **Discussion:** Updated `dashboard.ts` and `dashboard.html` to integrate with the new `dashboard-stats` API. Removed mock logic and updated bindings to use the returned `TotalRevenue` and `TotalIntake` values correctly.
* **Files Modified:**
  - `client/src/app/services/finance.service.ts`
  - `client/src/app/components/finance/dashboard/dashboard.ts`
  - `client/src/app/components/finance/dashboard/dashboard.html`

---

## Phase 48: Finance Organizer Payout Page
* **Request:** Add a dedicated "Organizer Payout" page to the Finance module, accessible from the sidebar below Transactions. The page should display event-level payout records with columns: Event ID, Organizer ID, Organizer Email, Amount (net of commission), Date, Time, and Status (Upcoming/Completed). No filters — only a sort option on the Status column.
* **Discussion:** 
  - Created a standalone `PayoutsComponent` with a dedicated CSS file (`payouts.css`).
  - The status sort is handled **client-side** using Angular's `computed()` signal to re-sort the current page's data immediately without re-fetching. Date-based sorting triggers a new API call for proper server-side ordering.
  - Three sort controls are displayed in the panel header: "Upcoming First", "Completed First", and "Latest First". The active control is highlighted in cardinal red.
  - Clicking the Status column header also toggles the sort direction.
  - Amount and date column headers are sortable with directional arrows.
  - Status badges use "Upcoming" → blue (`#1565C0`) and "Completed" → green (`#2E7D32`).
  - The `getPayouts()` method in `FinanceService` passes `sortBy`, `page`, and `size` to the backend.
  - Added route `/finance/payouts` in `app.routes.ts`.
  - Registered `PayoutsComponent` in all Finance module sidebars (Dashboard, Transactions, Escalations).
* **Files Created:**
  - `client/src/app/components/finance/payouts/payouts.ts`
  - `client/src/app/components/finance/payouts/payouts.html`
  - `client/src/app/components/finance/payouts/payouts.css`
* **Files Modified:**
  - `client/src/app/app.routes.ts`
  - `client/src/app/services/finance.service.ts`

## Phase 49: Finance Escalations Page — Full Rebuild
* **Request:** The Escalations page must show a rich table with Ticket ID, Attendee Email, Subject, Escalation Type, Target Type, Created At, and Status columns. Clicking a row opens a modal with full action details, a Related Entity popover, and Approve/Decline buttons.
* **Discussion:**
  - **Table**: Clickable rows highlight on hover. Columns are sortable by Escalation Type, Target Type, and Created At. Default sort is Created At descending.
  - **Modal**: Shows Action ID, Admin ID, Ticket ID, Escalation/Target type badges, Created At, and Target Entity ID (as a clickable anchor). Clicking the Target ID fetches and shows a popover with event details (title, status, organizer, date).
  - **Approve Flow**: Clicking "Approve" slides down an inline form with a Refund Type selector (FUL/DYN/REM/NOR) with contextual hints per selection, an optional message field, and a "Proceed" button. Calls `POST /api/finance/actions/{id}/approve`.
  - **Success Animation**: After approval, a green animated SVG checkmark is shown with the text "Action #{id} Approved". The modal auto-closes after 2.5 seconds.
  - **Decline Flow**: Clicking "Decline" slides down an inline form requiring a reason field. Calls `POST /api/finance/actions/{id}/decline`. Closes after 1.5 seconds on success.
  - Status badges: `Pending` → amber, `Processing` → blue, `Processed/Completed` → green, `Declined/Failed` → red.
  - Approve/Decline buttons only appear when status is `Pending`.
* **Files Created:**
  - `client/src/app/components/finance/escalations/escalations.css`
* **Files Modified:**
